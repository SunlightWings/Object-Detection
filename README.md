Object detection means identifying an object within an image. 
Bounding box is the most common form of object detection, where the goal is to draw a bounding box around the object in an image.
Keypoint detection involves identifying specific points of interest on an object, such as joints on a human body, corners of a building, or keypoints on an animal.
Pose estimation is concerned with estimating the pose (position and orientation) of an object or person. 
Object detection further encompasses segmentation(instance or semantic), human counting in a scene, event detection,etc. 
Here, we just keep the focus on human pose detection.
